<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> <a title="@amirhhz" href="http://twitter.com/amirhhz" target="_blank">Amir Hajizamani</a>, Computer Science Undergraduate</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge</a>, UK</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Academic Year 2010-11</p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> A blog covering mainly the progress of my final year <a title="CST2 Individual Project" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/projects/" target="_blank">project and dissertation</a> on <em>recommender systems in social networks</em>, and the inevitable off-topic meanderings.</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> To encourage me to articulate said progress, and for the benefit of any others interested in similar ventures.</p>
<h2>The Long Version</h2>
<p>I study <a title="CompSci" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at the University of Cambridge. Currently (2010-11) I am in my <a title="CST2" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/part2.html">final year of the undergraduate course</a> and I intend to use this blog to document my progress in carrying out my <a title="CST2 Individual Projects" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/projects/">dissertation project</a>, focusing on recommendation engines, hopefully in a social networking context. My supervisor is <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/">Dr. Cecilia Mascolo</a>. I shall flesh out a little more detail on this as things develop. My <a title="Public bookmarks related to my dissertation" href="http://www.delicious.com/amirhhz/dissertation" target="_blank">delicious bookmarks related to my dissertation</a> might be interesting on a slow day.</p>
<p>What else? I like photography, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/amirhhz">here is some evidence</a>. I used to run <a title="Jazz@John's" href="http://www.jazzatjohns.co.uk" target="_blank">Jazz@John's</a>. That should be enough for the stalkers to find out the rest.</p>
<p>I'll probably be changing the design and structure of the blog as I write more, so I welcome friendly suggestions for a more meaning tagline, Wordpress themes and plugins to try out, or whatever.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
