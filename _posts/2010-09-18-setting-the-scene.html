<p>If you're wondering why you're here or whether you should be here, have a peak at the <a title="About" href="/blog/about/">About page</a>...</p>
<p>...still here? Great! That's all the warning you're getting.</p>
<p>So, it's September and a few weeks until the Cambridge academic term begins. I have been wisely informed that a good student ought to have his dissertation proposal written by start of term. I'm having a go at being an even better student by making a start on the actual project before then, and here I'll just give the preamble to the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2009, I interned at <a title="Mixcloud" href="http://www.mixcloud.com">Mixcloud</a> with CTO <a href="http://twitter.com/matclayton">Mat Clayton</a> for a while. I saw how exciting it was being part of a fresh enterprise (Mixcloud publicly launched just a few weeks after I left) and learnt a bunch of stuff that's not relevant for now, but I might write about later. At the end of my time there, a few ideas for my final year project came up and the one that struck a chord with me was writing a recommendation engine (or as some prefer, recommender system) for Mixcloud. I'd always viewed recommendations on sites like Amazon and Facebook with mixed feelings - part fascinated ("Wow, yes, I DO want to buy a tie-rack, too! Thanks, <a title="Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos">Mr. Bezos</a>, you're a mind reader!"), part violated ("No, I don't Like the overhyped non-celebrities that my so-called friends have given consistent thumbs-ups to")Â  - but I certainly was curious about them.</p>
<p>Think of Mixcloud as "<a title="Mixcloud - About" href="http://www.mixcloud.com/about/">YouTube of Radio</a>" - their own tagline. Now think of Twitter on top of that. You have users uploading audio content aka 'Cloudcasts', listening, following each other, favouriting, commenting, etc. with the result being a great, young and growing online community of audio producers and listeners. To make this an analyst's dream, the site encourages (forces, even) uploaders to provide a rich set of metadata for each piece of content.</p>
<p>So a year later, in which the website has had incredible growth, I am raring to get going with my project. I sent around a draft of my proposal to people at the <a title="University of Cambridge, Computer Laboratories" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Computer Labs</a> who I thought may be interested in supervising my project, or at least not mind doing so, and I was surprised and pleased to land myself the <a title="Dr. Cecilia Mascolo" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/">perfect supervisor for this field</a> in a great team. After a meeting or two, I have some ideas as to how to move forward, and the next action is data-gathering. Luckily, Mixcloud quietly released <a href="http://api.mixcloud.com">their API</a> not long ago which, with their consent, shall be my source of data. There are alternative datasets (e.g. <a href="http://www.grouplens.org/node/12">movies</a>), but Mixcloud is what makes this project exciting for me.</p>
<p>At this stage, I'm looking forward to doing the following, and I'll write about each as and when appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing my first data scraper, if my data is to come from the Web or an API</li>
<li>Shaping the data into some sensible format for storage and analysis, most likely straight from JSON to CouchDB or MongoDB</li>
<li>Producing a list of techniques and algorithms that I could feasibly use to produce the recommendations</li>
<li>Given all the above, draft an evaluation strategy</li>
<li>Ensuring any legal agreements necessary are signed through</li>
<li>Finalizing and clarifying my proposal (then I can link to it from this blog!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Six things. That should be fine.</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks to <a title="Dr. Liam McNamara" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ljjm2/" target="_blank">Liam</a> for his input :)</p>
