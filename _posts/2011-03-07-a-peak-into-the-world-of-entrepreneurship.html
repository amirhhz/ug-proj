<h3><span style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="http://twitter.com/nikhilshah" target="_blank">Nikhil Shah</a>, Mixcloud Co-founder</span></h3>
<p><em>As a student</em></p>
<p><em> </em>BSc Mathematics at Gonville &amp; Caius, 2002-2005.</p>
<p>Lots of extra-curricular activities, mostly involving music and events - DJing, radio show on CUR1350, promoting clubnights, Ents Officer for Caius Ball, Ents for Caius Student Union.<br />
Also spent a year after graduating working full time for CUSU as Ents Manager.</p>
<p><em>What did you do after graduating?</em></p>
<p>First year out of University was spent working for CUSU. Great transition between University life and the real world, and got to see another side to the city!<br />
Then spend 2 years working as a brand consultant for an awesome boutique consultancy called The Value Engineers. Worked with some incredibly smart people on fascinating projects for brands such as Sony, BSkyB, Unilever and Sony Ericsson.Learned a lot in these 2 years - only truly appreciated just how much once I was out of the job and started running my own business.</p>
<p><em>What were your ambitions and career goals during or after your studies?</em></p>
<p>Fairly fluid - I knew I wanted to work in a sector or role that was both analytical and creative. This led me to marketing and specifically brand consultancy.I had lots of interests which I wanted to explore - music, events promotions, maths, marketing.</p>
<p>People put a lot of pressure on that 1st job out of University. It's important to start right and set yourself up with a good platform, but it's really not your job for life. Life's a lot more transient these days so be willing to adapt and shift.</p>
<p><em>What advice would you give your younger self knowing what you know now?</em></p>
<p>Absorb as much as you can at every stage of your life and career - you're always learning lessons that will shape who you are and what you do.If you can be more aware of this and walk through life with your eyes wider open, you'll hopefully absorb more.</p>
<p><em>Has the "economic downturn" had any effect on your  ventures?</em></p>
<p>For sure, indirectly. Advertisers are spending less, investors are tightening their purses and investing more conservatively.However on a day to day basis we hardly notice it. We're just getting on with building our product, audience and revenue streams, and as a young company we don't really have any precedent to compare it to.</p>
<p><em>How did you get to the current stage of your career? What kind of risks did you have to take?</em></p>
<p>As an Indian Mathematician, the obvious choice would have been working in the city! Instead I chose to opt for less money but to do something I really enjoyed.This, combined with starting my own business, has meant that for the last few years of my life I've been considerably poorer than many of my peers. A sacrifice but well worth it for the benefits!<br />
In terms of the younger me, I was always scheming and coming up with little ideas or ventures - from my first parties when I was 16.</p>
<p><em>Please give a summary of your current venture and the motivations for it, and what your role is within it.</em></p>

<h3><a href="http://twitter.com/nicoperez" target="_blank">Nico Perez</a>, Mixcloud Co-founder</h3>
<p><em>As a student</em></p>
<p>I studied Engineering at Emmanuel College, specialising in aeronautical engineering. During my spare time I setup and ran Cambridge's first breakdancing society. I also had a weekly radio show on CUR1350, and was involved with a group of DJs and hip hop aficionados called "The Get Down crew"</p>
<p><em>What did you do after graduating?</em></p>
<p><em> </em>I worked as analyst in a renewable energy consultancy, analysing expected energy outputs from potential wind farms.</p>
<p><em>What were your ambitions and career goals during or after your studies?</em></p>
<p><em> </em>I was interested in getting involved with disruptive technologies, both green energy, the internet, etc.</p>
<p><em>What advice would you give your younger self knowing what you know now?</em></p>
<p>Balance, patience, and a little bit of luck go a longway.</p>
<p><em>Has the "economic downturn" had any effect on your  ventures?</em></p>
<p><em> </em>Yes and no.<br />
Yes - it has meant it's more difficult to get funding.<br />
No - we have had to been even more committed, which is a good thing</p>
<p><em>How did you get to the current stage of your career? What kind of risks did you have to take?</em></p>
<p>After working for over a year as an analyst, I quit my job and decided to setup Mixcloud. This was a big risk considering we had no form of investment, or team at the time.</p>
<p><em>Please give a summary of your current venture and the motivations for it, and what your role is within it.</em></p>
<p>Co-founder of Mixcloud.com. Mixcloud's vision is to build the home for on-demand radio online. Online radio is currently very fragmented, making it difficult for both discovery and promotion. Mixcloud connects relevant content to listeners more effectively by re-thinking radio - making it more social, personal and democratic.Mixcloud was founded by Mat, Nico and Nikhil - 3 graduates from Cambridge University who set out to solve their frustrations as radio fans and DJs. The site was launched in September 2009 to a fantastic press reception – with mentions from the BBC, Guardian, Independent and WIRED to name a few. Since launch the site has seen strong growth and now has thousands of global content partners – from bedroom enthusiasts to the BBC, NME, Time Out and Ministry of Sound, reaching over half a million people per month.The business currently makes revenue from advertising and sponsoring – working with brands ranging from Diesel, Universal Music and Red Bull to Sony Ericsson and O2. The next stage of development for Mixcloud is to roll out mobile applications for the iPhone and Android platforms alongside a paid premium account.</p>
<h3><a href="http://twitter.com/matclayton" target="_blank">Mat Clayton</a>, Mixcloud Co-founder and CTO</h3>
<p><em>As a student</em></p>
<p>Engineering, (Electrical and Information Science), also played a lot of Squash as well, for the uni.</p>
<p><em>What did you do after graduating?</em></p>
<p><em> </em>Setup a company called Wakari, doing Embedded consultancy (mainly for the oil industry), then setup Sponsor-Me a facebook app for collecting donations. After that I moved into the doing Facebook apps for clients and then setup Webticketing/Mixcloud. And now work 100% on Mixcloud.</p>
<p><em>What were your ambitions and career goals during or after your studies?</em></p>
<p><em></em>Work for myself, on something I enjoy doing. Life is short, so best make the most of it whilst you can. I'd also rather fail 10 companies I enjoyed doing, than become successful in a job a I hate.</p>
<p><em>What advice would you give your younger self knowing what you know now?</em></p>
<p>Time is key, move fast, iterate.</p>
<p><em>How would you describe your profession to someone you've just met at the pub? What's the normal reaction?</em></p>
<p>I build the interwebs, particularly www.mixcloud.com</p>
<p><em>How do others' perceptions of what you do for a living compare to how you feel about it yourself?</em></p>
<p>Normally they think its really cool, and wish they could jump ship also. Parents were initially very concerns about career prospects, however now are far more relaxed about it, and see this as a very viable career.</p>
<p><em>How does life as an employee compare with that of an entrepreneur or freelancer? What are their best and worst aspects?</em></p>
<p>Can't say, I've been an employee in the past, but only part time, which is always different.Main difference I see when talking to mates however is that if I'm having a bad day, or just want to go out for a run at 2pm, I'll leave the office and go, no questions asks. Work is done when the team is productive and in the mood, family and live come first. However we all love our job and without a doubt I can say I can phone every member of the team at midnight and they will be keen to chat about work.</p>
<p><em>What do you aim for on a daily basis?</em></p>
<p>Improve the Site/Product</p>
<p><em>Where do you see your career heading in the future?</em></p>
<p><em></em>I have no idea</p>
<p><em>What's the ultimate career goal for you?</em></p>
<p>Make Mixcloud the defacto standard for audio hosting.</p>
<p><em>How does your career trajectory compare to your classmates' and colleagues'?</em></p>
<p>Positive, Members of the team keep getting job offers, which means something is going right, and people always seem keen people who are self motivated.</p>
<p><em>How do you feel about students being encouraged to be more entrepreneurial? Do you feel it's instinct or does it take nurturing?</em></p>
<p>Its a great thing, they need a natural curiosity, but also need to see that it can work out well, and better than a normal career.</p>
<p><em>Has the "economic downturn" had any effect on your  ventures?</em></p>
<p><em></em>We never tried to make money outside of the recession, so not really sure of the impacts it had at the moment, we will find out more as the economy recovers.</p>
<p><em>How did you get to the current stage of your career? What kind of risks did you have to take?</em></p>
<p><em></em>Can't say I got there, more had to create it. I wouldn't say it was a risk, just after university you have very little bagage (children/mortgage etc) and therefore the downside isn't that bad if things go really wrong. However if things go right, its life changing. Therefore to me it was a sensible decision, but most dont see it that way.</p>

<p>Mixcloud CTO, hopefullu you know what we do :)</p>
<h3><a href="http://twitter.com/martinkl" target="_blank">Martin Kleppmann</a>, Rapportive Co-founder</h3>
<p><em>As a student</em></p>
<p>Compsci at Corpus, Cambridge, 2003-2006, top of class. Spent lots of time doing music — Corpus chapel choir, conducted the Corpus college orchestra, CUMS chorus, played in an alt-rock band, etc</p>
<p><em>What did you do after graduating?</em></p>
<p><em></em>Tried a postgraduate course in music composition in Glasgow but gave up. Returned to Cambridge, started a startup, sold it after 2.5 years, then started Rapportive.</p>
<p><em>What were your ambitions and career goals during or after your studies?</em></p>
<p><em></em>I didn't have particularly concrete goals, just wanted to do something interesting with my life and make a difference. The concrete details have always been very changeable. For a while I thought I wanted to do a PhD; I got funding, but then gave it up again. For a while I thought about joining a management consultancy; I did an interview, hated it, and gave that idea up also. For a while I got a bee in my bonnet about founding a company and selling it; that one worked out.</p>
<p><em>What advice would you give your younger self knowing what you know now?</em></p>
<p>Don't worry about getting things right first time. Very few mistakes are irrecoverable. Instead, be bold, constantly push yourself outside of your comfort zone, and just go for it even if you have no idea how. It'll work out.</p>
<p><em>How would you describe your profession to someone you've just met at the pub? What's the normal reaction?</em></p>
<p><em></em>I run a software company. They ask whether I am going to be the next Bill Gates. I roll my eyes and say that the chances are pretty slim.</p>
<p><em>How do others' perceptions of what you do for a living compare to how you feel about it yourself?</em></p>
<p>I think entrepreneurship is mainly a matter of never being satisfied, never giving up, always trying harder. Others seem to think that some sort of special talent is required. I don't think so, unless you count doggedness as a talent. Being an entrepreneur is stressful, and you pretty much have to give up your social life in order to be successful. But the upside is huge: you have the potential for making a big difference to many people's lives, and even if you fail, you will have learnt a ton and you will have made yourself a lot more valuable (even if you choose to go back to being an employee later).I do understand why many people choose to go for a fairly easy job; if you just want a pleasant, quiet life and don't have great ambition, getting a job is probably just the right thing for you. I fully respect that.However, I fail to understand why anyone would want to become an employee a stressful, demanding job at a big company. It seems like the worst of both worlds. You don't have a life, but you're nevertheless a small wheel in a big machine.</p>
<p><em>Have there been any external influences, people or organisations, who have had a significant effect on getting you where you are?</em></p>
<p>I have worked with many wonderful people over the last few years, and they have all had a significant effect.</p>
<p><em>How and where have you picked up the business know-how necessary to succeed in your field?</em></p>
<p>By just going out and doing it. You don't need a degree to figure this stuff out; it's pretty much common sense.</p>
<p><em>What do you aim for on a daily basis?</em></p>
<p>Do something which makes our users happy.</p>
<p><em>Where do you see your career heading in the future?</em></p>
<p>No idea; figuring it out as I go along.</p>
<p><em>What's the ultimate career goal for you?</em></p>
<p><em></em>To be able to look back on my life and have no regrets.</p>
<p><em>How does your career trajectory compare to your classmates' and colleagues'?</em></p>
<p>Unusual.</p>
<p><em>How do you feel about students being encouraged to be more entrepreneurial? Do you feel it's instinct or does it take nurturing?</em></p>
<p><em></em>I think everybody would benefit from entrepreneurship being more "normal". That would best be achieved by showing that it's actually quite simple. Forget about free legal advice, patents, finance, and all that crap — it just makes everything look more complicated and scary. Whereas actually, it's quite simple: make something that people want to use, tell people about it, and don't give up.</p>
<p><em>Has the "economic downturn" had any effect on your  ventures?</em></p>
<p><em></em>No. I was hoping for a positive effect (good technical people being made redundant and being available for hire), but not even that has happened. The job market for good software engineers at startups is as hot as it's always been. It's really hard to find good employees.</p>
<p><em>How did you get to the current stage of your career? What kind of risks did you have to take?</em></p>
<p><em></em>Learning something new and taking new risks every day. Not sure what you're asking for.</p>
<p><em>Please give a summary of your current venture and the motivations for it, and what your role is within it.</em></p>
<p><em></em>Rapportive, which tells you all you need to know about your contacts, right inside Gmail. We started Rapportive out of our own experience of need: in our previous startups, we spent a lot of time talking to customers and potential customers, trying to get to know them and establish rapport. We found this to be a huge amount of effort because we didn't have decent tools to support us. Then we realised that we weren't the only people trying to stay on top of lots of personal contacts, and started building a product to solve that problem.I'm one of three co-founders, and do my fair share share of any type of work.</p>
