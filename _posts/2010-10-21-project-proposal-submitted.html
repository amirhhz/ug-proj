<p>I have now officially submitted <a href="/dissertation/proposal/">my project proposal</a> and you can find it <a href="/dissertation/proposal/">here</a> (direct to <a href="/dissertation/proposal/html/">HTML</a> or<a href="/dissertation/proposal/proposal-submission.pdf"> PDF</a>).</p>
<p>It is wordy and fuzzy because that's how you say you will do something without committing to anything concrete to avoid shooting yourself in the foot later on. The main challenge was coming up with an evaluation framework that would be feasible and flexible enough for different implementation techniques.</p>
<p>I will post an entry soon on how I've been gathering data from the <a href="http://api.mixcloud.com/" target="_blank">Mixcloud API</a>, storing it in <a href="http://http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> and using<a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/"> Redis</a>' persistent caching to make it all silky smooth.</p>
